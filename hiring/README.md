In-person questions
-------------------

* Describe a time you missed a deadline.
* How would you explain databases to a very smart 10-year-old?
* How would you deal with people in very different timezones?
* How do you know if you offended someone or made them uncomfortable? How would you deal with it?
* Let's say someone disagrees with you on a technical issue. How would you approach that disagreement?
