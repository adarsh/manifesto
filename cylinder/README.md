## Evaluating Performance and Feedback

The purpose of a performance evaluation is
a) To understand how valuable someone is to the organization and ensure they are
compensated appropriately. 
b) Guide employees on how best to master their craft.

Maybe these should be separate processes...

Employee performance should be evaluated on how well they embody the attributes
of the ideal employee (see below).

Evaluation should be done by all peers in the organization on a scale of 1-10.
The results are averaged and shared back with the teammate.

It should take no more than 15 minutes to complete for someone to minimize the
organizational overhead.

The leadership should also have a quarterly performance review based on the same
attributes.

The company itself should also have a quarterly performance review.
