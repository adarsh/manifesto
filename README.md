# A Software Development Manifesto

## Motivation

After building web software for many years,
I've come to develop some beliefs about
how to do so effectively, efficiently,
and with the happiest team.

All opinions are my own,
although most are based on
solid ideas from other smart people.
Those smarties are attributed
when I can remember to do so.

## Managing the Software Development Process

### Demos

* The only measure of progress is shipped working software in production
  (from [The Agile Manifesto]).
  This means no velocity, no burndown charts, no story points or counting.
* Every Friday afternoon, the team should demo the product to whoever pays for
  it. That's the best way of being accountable.
* The product should ship to real users as soon as possible,
  ideally within a few weeks.
  Further features should only be based on user feedback,
  not someone's fever dreams.
  You are not Steve Jobs.

### Daily Standup Meetings

### Planning

* Every Monday Morning, have a Planning Meeting. The purpose is to list all the
  user stories worth working on that week and prioritize them. That's it.
* Every user story should be validated somehow with actual or potential users.
  You can do so via prototyping, A/B testing, False Doors, etc. but if it's just
  someone's idea, you are throwing money away and wasting everyone's time.
* The people who are actually building the software are in the best position to
  design and alter the tools, communication flows, and project management
  philosophy.
* The best project management tools, in order, are Trello, Stickie Notes,
  and Nothing. If you need more than this, you are likely planning too far ahead
  into the future or too far down in the implementation details, or both.

#### Estimation

* Estimating how long something will take to build (or estimating effort)
  is, at best, a worthless activity and at worst,
  damaging to the team's trust and dynamic.
  Estimates are never correct, or even close to accurate.
  They do not help product owners "decide which features to buy"
  because the cost is always unknown.
  Measuring "how much we got done this week"
  only decreases development efficiency.


#### Language

* The term "Backlog" is extremely discouraging and should be avoided. Think
  about having a "backlog" on day 1 of the project: You haven't even started and
  you're already behind!
* Marking time in "sprints" clearly tells the developers to
  "work at an unhealthy pace until you can't go on anymore".
  Language is important.

### Team

* Software is best built with at least one other person.
  It's not impossible to do by yourself, but it won't come out as well
  and certainly won't be as much fun.

## Writing Healthy Code

### Testing

* Software is most cheaply, happily, and safely written with
  very high test coverage.
* The tests should be written first. There are no exceptions. Spikes are helpful
  research, but should be deleted.
* RSpec is the best tool for testing Ruby code. It is well-maintained and
  evolves with the community.

### Style

* Your project needs a style guide. Ideally, it should be enforced
  automatically.

### Code Review

* Pull requests should be small and take no longer than a day to write. If need
  be, create pull requests into non-master branches or feature-flag your work.
* Code Review should be considerate and thoughtful.
  See [thoughtbot's helpful guide to code review] for specifics.

### Deploying

* Deploying the code to staging or production should be a one-line command.
  It should not take longer than 5 minutes in total. If it does, your project
  will slow down dramatically.
* Heroku is best for most projects
  until they have a significant compelling reason to switch off.
  Those reasons can include "We just raised $50m" or
  "We need to be PCI compliant".
* There is a massive labor cost
  for running your own infrastructure
  or doing custom deploys.
  It is not even close to outweighed by
  paying Heroku a little more for servers.

### External Libraries and Frameworks

* Every Monday morning, [update your dependencies].
* Your project has a "cleverness budget". Use exotic/new tools sparingly - they
  are a pain.

## On App Ideas

* Worthless. The value comes only in shipping software, talking to users, and
  iterating based on that feedback as quickly and intelligently as possible.
