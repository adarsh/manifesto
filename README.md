# A Software Development Manifesto

## Why?

After building software for many years,
I've come to develop some beliefs
about how to do so effectively,
efficiently,
and with the happiest team.

All opinions are my own,
although most are based on
solid ideas from other smart people.
Those smarties are attributed
when I can remember to do so.

### Managing the Software Development Process

* Software is best built with at least one other person.
  It's not impossible to do by yourself, but it won't come out as well
  and certainly won't be as much fun.
* The best project management tools, in order, are Trello, Stickie Notes,
  and Nothing. If you need more than this, you are likely overplanning into the
  future or too far down in the implementation details, or both.
