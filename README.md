# A Software Development Manifesto

## Why?

After building software for many years,
I've come to hold some beliefs
about how to do so effectively,
efficiently,
and with the best team.

All opinions are my own,
although most are based on
solid ideas from other smart people.
Those smarties are attributed
when I can remember to do so.
